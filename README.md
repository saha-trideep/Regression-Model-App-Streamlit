# Breast Cancer Diagnosis App

## OverView
Hey there! So, I recently built my first project â€“ the Breast Cancer Diagnosis app! ðŸš€ I created it with the help of some awesome tutorials on YouTube. The app is like a cool virtual assistant for medical professional, helping them figure out if a breast lump is something to worry about or not.

Here's the gist: you input some measurements, and the app uses fancy machine learning tricks to predict if the lump is harmless or might need some attention. It even shows a radar chart with the data and tells you the chances of it being either good or not-so-great.

And get this â€“ you can either type in the measurements yourself or connect it up to a lab machine for the data. Just a heads up, though, the app doesn't do the lab connection thing on its own.

I built this app as part of my learning journey in machine learning, using a dataset called ['Breast Cancer Wisconsin'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) ðŸ¤“
You can actually check out a live version of the app on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://8vcndpz6vixttytx7bdcny.streamlit.app/).

## Getting Started: Breast Cancer Diagnosis App ðŸš€
Before you dive in, make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
Clone the Repository:[git clone](https://github.com/saha-trideep/Regression-Model-App-Streamlit.git)


Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


This command will install all the necessary packages, including Streamlit,Scikit_Learn, Plotly.

##Run the App:

streamlit run main.py

Open your browser to see the Breast Cancer Diagnosis App in action!


Feel free to explore the app, and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. Happy coding! ðŸŒŸ

Note: This project was developed using Python version 3.7."
